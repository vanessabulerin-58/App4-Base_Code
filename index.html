Brief Description of Goal of Code:
To make a "diagnostic" app that allows for individuals  wondering if they're suffering from lupus or rosacea to answer a series of questions with either yes or no - outputting and recording their results to "diagnose" them with either symptoms of lupus or rosacea, while learning how to code using 3 different language and input an image into the HTML code.
 
Known Issues:
Trouble with inputting an image that would actually display to the user. 
Ignore this error message if you see it using the javaScript console: Error with Permissions-Policy header: Origin trial controlled feature not enabled: 'interest-cohort'.
